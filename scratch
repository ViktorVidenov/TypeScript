Phone
1. Define a class that holds information about a mobile phone device: model, manufacturer, price, owner, battery characteristics (model, hours idle and hours talk) and display characteristics
(size and number of colors). 
2. Define 3 separate classes (class Phone holding instances of the classes Battery and Display).
3. Assume that model and manufacturer are mandatory (the others are optional).
4. Add an enumeration BatteryType (Li-Ion, NiMH, NiCd, â€¦) and use it as a new field for the batteries.
5. Add a method in the Phone class for displaying all information about it.
6. Create a class Call to hold a call performed through a Phone. It should contain date, time, dialed phone number and duration (in seconds).
7. Add a property CallHistory in the Phone class to hold a list of the performed calls.
8. Add methods in the Phone class for adding and deleting calls from the calls history. Add a method to clear the call history.
9. Add a method that calculates the total price of the calls in the call history. Assume the price per minute is fixed and is provided as a parameter.


<!-- Good Practice - for every different class to have another diff interface/models -->
